# PCB-Library
Library of pcb symbols and libraries we commonly use.

## Naming Conventions
Symbol and footprint library names should have the general component type. If there are multiple parts of the name, underscores should be used in place of spaces.
	TypeA_TypeB.*
	e.g. Connectors_Socket.lib, MCU.lib, Motors.lib

Individual part symbols and footprints should match the part used. If there is a family of components but they all have the same footprint, create a single footprint that has the family series designation of the the component the name.
